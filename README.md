Library application project.

The application will initially be developed in Java with a heavy emphasis on the backend side of things and then converted to C# in order to create the graphical interface.

**WARNING: The Java code is not properly functioning and was only used for design purposes. If you want to run the final projects check the Executable Version Branch. If you want to check the code behind the final application use the C# branch.**
